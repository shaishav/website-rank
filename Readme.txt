Page-Rank
by Shaishav Siddhpuria

Page-Rank is a simple program implementing Google's page rank algorithm to rank  a list of websites. One can specify a random jump factor that dictates the probability that the random surfer lands on a random page.

It uses the Armadillo C++ library for algebra computation and is necessary for compilation.
